Description:
-------

This application tracks the base station IDs and signal strengths for
LTE (1900 MHz) and 1xRTT base stations (on the ESMR band used by
Sprint).  The data may be useful for mapping out base station
locations and coverage.

Developed for the S4GRU community at http://s4gru.com

This code may also work on non-Sprint LTE devices, but there are no
guarantees.  LTE base stations IDs are only available currently with
HTC devices; they may also be available on devices running custom ROMs
based on Android 4.1 and later that implement the CellIdentityLte API.
